Problem: This program uses CSV's full of distance information, location information, and package information to create packages for three
theoretical trucks to use. Each truck is loaded with packages and sets out to deliver them using the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm before they
return to the original point.

Directions: To run the program, load it up within PyCharm and click the green arrow button. Once you enter a time within the
console, you can select several options. Type 1 to print out a status report of trucks and how many total miles they have each traveled.
Type 2 to print out specific data for a package. Type 3 to get a detailed report of every package. Type 4 to enter in a new time.
Type 5 to exit the program.
